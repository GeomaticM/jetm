      Timer implementations used for performance measurement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the used Java Virtual Maschine and the underlying Operating System
      timer implementations will return different resolutions and thus influence the
      collected statistics directly. See {@link etm.core.timer.ExecutionTimer}
      for further details.
